                    My name is Mitchell Dodell. I am a Sophomore at Brandeis University studying
                    Computer Science and Business. Born and raised in the 120&deg; landscape that is Arizona, I traded my sunglasses and ever-present
                    air conditioning for a pair of Timbs and a winter coat in my pursuit of education at Brandeis
                    University.

            Mitchell joined Vibo as a full stack developer intern during the summer of 2018 under my mentorship.
            With only a little experience with our specific technological stack; in a short amount of time and tons
            of motivation, Mitchell managed to build an amazing end-to-end product that our customers will soon be using. He taught himself the related technologies needed for
            the product, and managed to overcome many obstacles in the development process.
            Mitchell is a highly motivated and exceptional young developer that I am sure will be very beneficial to
            anyone that will have him work for them. I highly recommend him and wish him the best of luck during his career!

            Brilliant — would be the best word I could use to describe the amazing Mitchell Dodell.
            Besides always being energetic, positive, warm and funny, Mitchell’s mind is continually turning —
            observing, examining, questioning, and looking for solutions for how things could be designed to work
            better and more efficiently.  He seems to require little sleep to keep him going at all hours of the day and night.
            Mitchell is a communicator, and always quickly responds to any queries I make of him.  It has been my great pleasure
            to know and to with him in multiple capacities over the past 3 or 4 years, and he has provided exceptional leadership
            and creative technological solutions for our Rotary-sponsored Interact District in Arizona.
